            In Nebraska, I worked in a relatively large work space. During the times of COVID-19, we were instructed to stay home and work from home if possible. <span id="one">_______________</span>. For about 2 months I got to stay home with my son, who at the time was 4 months old. Then one day, I recieved a message on our messaging app that said all of the Russian linguists had to come in to work, which meant that myself and 7 other people now had to start reporting to work again. <span id="two">_____________</span>

            I was very sad that I had to start leaving my son at daycare again and nervous that he may get sick from another child there. Unfortunately, there was no one else around to watch him so daycare was my only option. <span id="three">_________________________</span> When I showed up the next day, I was happy to see all of my friends that I hadn't seen in a very long time.  <span id="four">__________________</span> One of these new faces is now my husband, Adam.
